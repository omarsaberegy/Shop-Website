      This is a website to help customers to shop online <br />

      Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. <br />

        The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software;<br />

         user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process,<br />

         although some designers will cover them all.The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up.<br />

         Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability <br />

        and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.<br />
